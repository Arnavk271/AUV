As per the notes given on pipeline depth ai, monoleft=pipeline.create(dai.node.MonoCam), monoleft.set.....etc etc..
On the basis of session 2, i understood the basics of pipeline and tried to watch few lecture videos to understand it in more depth 
It basically like you're turning on a cam and displaying what the camera sees in a window
Pipeline just means a step by step flow where the camera captures something and passes it to your code.
You connect the OAK-D camera, and use DepthAI and OpenCV to grab the video
Then, you use OpenCV to  show the live video coming from the camera...

problems faced- time management and the functions used in python were'nt familiar so i had to use ai to undertand the codes used and also view yt vids to understand pipeline in detail
