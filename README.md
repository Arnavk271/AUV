Name: Arnav Kaknoor

Branch: Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence

Roll Number: CS24B2045


I have a strong interest in robotics and AI applications. As a kid, I used to build models of robots and gadgets to keep myself entertained and interested. I was always curious about how machines move, and interact with their surroundings. That spiked my interest in robotics and artificial intelligence, and I'm now eager to learn about real-world applications using platforms like ROS and hands on team like AUV. I am excited to join the AUV team because I wanna combine software intelligence with robots, particularly for autonomous navigation and control. 

I believe that being a part of AUV will allow me to explore robotics from new perspectives â€” a perfect match for my interests in ROS and machine learning.
